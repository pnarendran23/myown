/**
 The annotation toolbar allows the creation of most annotation types supported by PSPDFKit.

 To customize which annotation icons should be displayed, edit `editableAnnotationTypes` in PSPDFDocument.
 Further appearance customization options are documented in the superclass header (`PSPDFFlexibleToolbar.h`).

 `PSPDFAnnotationToolbar` needs to be used together with a `PSPDFFlexibleToolbarContainerView` just like its superclass `PSPDFFlexibleToolbar`.
 
 @note Directly updating `buttons` will not work. Use `additionalButtons` if you want to add custom buttons.
